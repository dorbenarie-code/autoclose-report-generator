[flake8]
# 1. max-line-length: Maximum number of characters per line.
#    - Set to 100 for readability; adjust to 79 if you want strict PEP 8 compliance.
max-line-length = 100

# 2. exclude: Files and directories to skip entirely.
#    - .git: Skip Git metadata.
#    - __pycache__: Skip Python bytecode caches.
#    - venv: Skip the virtual environment folder.
#    - build, dist: Skip packaging/distribution folders.
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    venv,
    build,
    dist

# 3. extend-ignore: Error codes to ignore in addition to flake8 defaults.
#    - E203: Whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black).
#    - W503: Line break before a binary operator (also conflicts with Black).
extend-ignore = E203, W503

# 4. select: Which categories of errors/warnings to enforce.
#    - C, E, F, W: Core flake8 categories (complexity, errors, formatting, warnings).
#    - B, B950: flake8‐bugbear checks (patterns likely to be bugs).
select = C,E,F,W,B,B950

# 5. (Optional) application-import-names: Your top-level package names.
#    - Helps flake8 distinguish between local imports and third-party modules.
#    - Uncomment and adjust if you have a package structure like "app" or "utils".
# application-import-names = app, utils

# 6. (Optional) per-file-ignores: Ignore specific error codes in certain files.
#    - Example: Avoid F401 (unused import) errors in __init__.py files.
#    - Example: Ignore missing docstring errors (D100, D101) in tests.
# per-file-ignores =
#     __init__.py: F401
#     tests/*.py: D100, D101

# 7. Notes:
#    • To keep imports sorted automatically, run `isort` before `flake8`.
#    • If you use `black`, run `black .` first so flake8 won’t flag formatting issues that Black would fix.
